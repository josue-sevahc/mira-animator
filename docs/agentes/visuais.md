# Visuals & data

Static visuals, charts, QR codes, true 3D and image-driven templates.

## `/mira-visuals`
Static images for slides: panels, diagrams, charts and infographics — when a concept is better shown as a fixed, dense visual than as motion.

## `/mira-chart`
Turns data into charts with impact: from a CSV/JSON, from an image of a chart, or from a hand-drawn sketch — and recommends the best chart type from a gallery.

## `/mira-chart-race`
Turns temporal data into an **animated race**: from a wide-format CSV (the first column is the period, the others are the series), it builds a slide where time runs on screen and the chart animates once to the end. Two modes to choose from: **bars** that swap rank position each period, or **lines** drawn progressively with the label chasing the tip. The data stays embedded in the slide (no `fetch`), so it runs from `file://` and offline. For a static chart use `/mira-chart`.

## `/mira-qrcode`
Inserts a large, centered, scannable **QR code** into a slide, generated from a link or text you provide. The QR is generated **locally** at build time (the `qrcode` npm package) and embedded as an inline SVG, with no runtime dependency, no external API and no CDN, so the slide works even from `file://`. Clean card, same pattern as `mira-3d`: just the slide title and the big QR, with no link caption underneath. Scannability drives the style: dark modules on a white card, quiet zone preserved, orange only on the frame and title. The QR stays static: the internal loop lives in the frame (glow pulse, breathing corners), never over the modules.

## `/mira-3d`
Adds a **true 3D element** to a slide's canvas (real depth, continuous auto-rotation and drag-to-rotate / zoom interaction) in a clean card where the element is maximized. It picks one of three layers from your request: pure CSS 3D (simple shapes), procedural Three.js (abstract forms like particle spheres and node networks, or low-poly objects built from primitives), or glTF (when you provide a `.glb`, or accept a search for a free, licensed model on the web). It inherits the mother-rule: the 3D never enters static, so auto-rotate pauses on drag and resumes.

!!! warning "The glTF layer needs a server"
    A slide that loads a local `.glb` does **not** open from `file://` (the browser blocks the model fetch), only over HTTP. In that case the agent starts a local server, hands you the `http://localhost` link, and writes a double-click launcher (`abrir-slide.cmd`) so you can present later. This layer needs **Node.js** installed. The CSS 3D and procedural layers use no local asset and open straight from `file://`, with no server.

## `/mira-svg-morph`
Generates a slide where one SVG shape **morphs into another**, in a continuous loop, with GSAP + MorphSVGPlugin vendored locally (the deck runs offline, from `file://`). You point it at 2 or more `.svg` files in the deck's `assets/`, in morph order: 2 SVGs go back and forth, N SVGs chain (A into B into C ... back to A). It inlines the `<path>`s with unique ids (no collision between several SVGs in one document), runs `convertToPath` on non-path shapes, and builds the loop. Clean card, same pattern as `mira-3d`: just the title and the shape morphing large and centered, in orange #FF904D. MorphSVG morphs path into path (not whole SVG into whole SVG): multi-path morphs pair by pair, only the silhouette morphs, and it is cleanest when both SVGs share the same viewBox. For dense or emergent metaphors (particles, explosions) use `mira-animator` instead.

## `/mira-icon-morph`
The same morph, but from **concepts in words** when you do not have the files. You say "a cloud turning into a lightbulb"; it searches the Iconify API, validates the license, downloads the SVGs, inlines them and builds the morph. It prefers single-path icons in viewBox 0 0 24 24 (they morph clean), uses only open licenses (MIT, Apache-2.0, CC0 or CC-BY), records attribution in the deck's `CREDITS.md`, and refuses protected IP (franchise characters), suggesting original art. The internet is used only at build time; the final deck stays offline. Reuses the render core of `mira-svg-morph`.

## `/mira-svg-animator`
Animates an SVG you provide, giving the shape its own motion (it does not turn into another shape, that is morph). You pass one `.svg` and describe the motion in words: flap wings, spin a wheel, slide, pulse, draw the outline, follow a curve. It picks the GSAP technique to match: transform (rotate/scale/translate), DrawSVG (the stroke draws itself) or MotionPath (motion along a curve). Key point: to animate a part, the part must be a separate element; if the SVG is a single merged path, it splits the part (clip by an axis, or edit the path to isolate or remove a segment, like keeping the antennae still). It also removes opaque backgrounds and sets the motion origin (the hinge or rotation center). Loop and `prefers-reduced-motion` honored; vendored GSAP, works from `file://`.

## `/mira-image-template`
Creates a **new deck template from image(s)**. You send screenshots of screens/slides and/or the logo, and the agent recognizes the whole design system (colors, background, typography, corners, shadows, glassmorphism, glows) and, when a screenshot is given, the **arrangement of the elements**, then builds a complete template: the skeleton `mira-templates/decks/<name>/index.html` with the identity embedded, plus the theme `mira-templates/themes/<name>.css`. At the end it asks for a **name** and saves. The template is then offered by `/mira-new` alongside the existing ones, and its same-name theme becomes the natural default. The screenshot drives the layout; the logo drives the palette.
